      <p>I appreciate how much we can use technology to create a better society for ourselves; programme a system and it will do what it is asked to do.</p>
      <p>Techonology improves our day to day tasks and activities, from simple tasks like editting a photo, to tasking activities like making organisational decisions using reports generated by a computer system from data, to diagnosing patients at health facilities...the possibilities now and in the future are endless, technology is definitely one of the best things that happened to us humans.</p>

        <p> <em><strong>What I have learned at Stutern:</strong></em></p>
        <p>I have learned the html elements that I use to create and put content on hmtl pages. I have learnt that some html elements for example <img>, have attributes which are important for them to function, html elements have tags-some have opening and close tags, for example: &lth1&gt, some are self closing, for example: the &ltbr&gt.</p>
        <p>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is used to style the html pages. With CSS, our html pages will have color, postioning, arrangement and styling. <br> Without CSS, html pages look like plain word documents, without color and style.</p>

        <p><strong>Paddings, Margins and Borders:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Padding:</strong> <em>The spacing inside an element-box or content -</em> this is spacing between the element and the box containing the element, padding helps us shift content from the edges of its container. Padding can be allocated with units such as px, rem or em, the larger the value of the unit, the larger the spacing.</p>
        <p><strong>Margins:</strong> <em>The spacing outside an element-box or content -</em> this is the spacing between and element and other boxes around it. Margin heps us shift an element away from touching other elements outside it. Margins can be allocated with units such as px, rem or em, the larger the value of the unit, the larger the spacing.</p>
        <p><strong>Border:</strong> <em>The border is used to wrap the content and padding</em> (if padding is allocated). Borders are like lines that can be styled as dots, solid lines or dashes, to whatever color and thickness - using px, rem or em. This section is wraped by a brown border.</p>
